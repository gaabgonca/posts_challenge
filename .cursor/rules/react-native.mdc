# React Native rules

- Use TypeScript for all files (.ts/.tsx extensions)
- Follow React Native ESLint config (@react-native)
- Prettier: single quotes, trailing commas, avoid arrow parens
- Import order: React first, then third-party, then local modules
- Use functional components with hooks
- StyleSheet.create for component styles
- SafeAreaProvider for safe area handling
- Use StatusBar with appropriate barStyle based on color scheme
- Follow a consistent folder structure within src directory (components, screens, navigation, services, hooks, utils, styles)
- Use React Navigation for screen navigation
- Use FlatList or SectionList for rendering lists instead of map + ScrollView
- Use custom hooks for reusable logic
- Implement proper error boundaries and loading states
- Optimize images and assets for mobile performance
- Use zustand for state management
- Put types and interfaces in src/types directory rather than in the code files
- Use constant values (create if needed) instead of literals for styling
- Separate core logic (zustand) and view logic
- Service response should go to zustand store
- FlatLists that show content retrieved from an api must have pull down to refresh
- Implement retry with backoff
- Handle network/API errors and log them via a mocked log(error, context) function
- Use memoization when relevant
- Define an explicit cache policy
